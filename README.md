# New York City Citi Bike Rides 2022-2024

My year-long project is based on total rides using Citi Bikes in New York City of 2022. Source of data came from [citibikenyc.com](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data)

My Tableau account only accepts a maximum of 20,000,000 rows and my data exceeds over triple the number of rows. I've used Python to create pivot tables, therefore drastically reducing the number of rows, yet aggregating all data. 

# Key Questions & Objectives

* Where do Citi Bikers ride to? 
* When do they ride? 
* What days of the week are most rides taken on? 
* Are bike riding habits the same for members and casual riders?

# Script

Here is the structure of the script:
