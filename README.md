# New York City Citi Bike Rides 2022

My year-long project is based on total rides using Citi Bikes in New York City of 2022. Source of data came from [citibikenyc.com](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data)

# Key Questions & Objectives

* Where do Citi Bikers ride to? 
* When do they ride? 
* What days of the week are most rides taken on? 
* What is the average time amount spent riding a Citi Bike?
* Are bike riding habits the same for members and casual riders?
